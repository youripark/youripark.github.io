<p><strong>Note on Cheating</strong></p>

<p>Remember that you're not allowed to share code, look at other code to debug, or talk about code that you've written.</p>

<p>What the official CS61A course policies state:</p>

<p>Cooperation has a limit, however, and in 61A that limit is code. Homework problems should be completed and turned in individually. Feel free to discuss the problems with others beforehand; just submit your own work in the end. This applies also to Projects 1 and 2.</p>

<p>To be clear, the following unfun and uncool activities will be considered cheating:</p>
<p>
Using another student's code on a solo assignment
Using code from a student who is not your partner on a partner assignment
Using code from previous students or from an online source
Sharing your code with other students or posting your code online
Failing to report any of the above
This list is not comprehensive: the instructors reserve the right to go beyond this list at any time in the face of actions that violate the spirit of the course.
